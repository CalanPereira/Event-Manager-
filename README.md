Event Management System Project Abstract:

Existing System:
In the existing system, there is a lot of paper work; it is very time consuming and uneconomical as most of the works include manual processing. The records are difficult to store in the manual system, and it requires more manual labor work.

Proposed System:
In the proposed event management system, everything is web-based. This will immediately reduce the manual processing, thereby increasing the speed of the  event management process. There are various functions and modules in the system to perform various features. This overall increases management productivity, eliminates paper works, reduces manpower, and proves to be very economical in the long run.

Features:
Event Management System being a web-based project, it is very simple, easy to use and flexible. The key features or functions of the project are:
Registration of participating students
Scheduling meeting
Inviting participants via email
Canceling events
Collecting feedback from students
Recording attendance details from faculty members
Generating various feedback reports
